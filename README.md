# GoogleNanodegree2_HabitTracker
Designing and creating the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI components; instead, focus is on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.
App learning goals: creating a SQLite table in your app, populating that table with new entries, modifying the entries, displaying the contents of the table to users.
